Each of the three scenarios below describes a fictional company's proposal for adding new features to their application:

- Is the company breaking any laws with their proposal?


- What are the ethical concerns with the company's proposal?

- What could the company do to address these issues?

##Scenario 1 (Banking Corp)

BankingCorp are one of the leading retail banks in the country, offering a full range of products including current accounts, savings products, credit cards and loans. They have in-depth knowledge of their customers' income, financial commitments and spending habits. They already offer some products where customers can pay a monthly fee and receive benefits in return. Some of these benefits include special offers from a curated list of third-party partners which customers can opt-in to receiving.

They have recently been approached by a payday loan company who want to send direct marketing to users struggling to pay their credit card bills. The loan company want to email the customers they feel would be most likely to use their services but acknowledge that manually identifying targets would be time-consuming and want to develop an algorithm to automate this. BankingCorp have given them access to their systems to test this algorithm, ensuring it works with real customer data. The loan company have had some negative publicity recently and so BankingCorp will not be announcing this new partnership publicly. Instead they will inform customers in an email explaining the changes to their terms and conditions.


### **Legal Compliance Analysis:**


**Data Privacy and Protection:** If BankingCorp shares customers' details without explicit consent from the customers they will be violating the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), there are strict requirements on how companies can use personal data. 
One of the requirements needed is a customer's explicit approval for any data to be shared with a third party. Just updating terms and conditions via email isn't enough to get this consent. There's a chance customers might not agree to their data being shared, so it's crucial to get their explicit approval as it wouldn't fulfil GDPR's requirement for explicit consent.




### **Ethical Considerations Analysis:**

**Addictive Design:** The automated marketing system may target financially vulnerable groups and this could cause the customers to spiral into more debt.

**Algorithmic bias:** The company must ensure that the algorithm isn't targetting a specific group of people.


**Corporate Ownership of Personal Data:** Sharing sensitive financial/customer data without asking for customers' permission breaks the trust they have in the company.

**Lack Of Transparency:** The lack of transparency about the partnership with the payday loan company can make customers feel like the bank is hiding something which impacts the customer's perception of the bank.

### **Addressing Ethical Issues:**

**Addictive Design:** The company needs to ensure that the algorithm is designed in a way that can identify financially vulnerable customers and not exploit those customers' vulnerabilities. Considering payday loan companies are usually known for their very high interest rates, it would be most ethical to prioritise the customer's financial well-being rather than leading them to become dependent on high-interest loans.

**Corporate Ownership of Personal Data:** Before sending any personal information ensure that the company receives explicit consent from the customer. This demonstrates that the company respects their privacy rights as mandated by GDPR and prioritises the customer's privacy before they're willing to share any personal information. 

- A possible method of doing this is by implementing a clear consent form that could be electronic or in letter form so the customers can opt-in to ensure they can make an informed decision.

**Transparency:** There should be transparency on the purpose of this partnership and what exactly the data sharing entails to foster trust. In regards to the partnership, there should be scrutiny on whether the 'payday loan' company values align with those of the company i.e. treating customers ethically.

## Scenario 2 (Treasure Hunters)
The new mobile game Treasure Hunters has been taking the country by storm. Players are shown an illustrated map and must find the hidden treasure by following clues and solving puzzles. The quicker a player finds the treasure the more points they score and they can compare their scores with their friends. Five new maps are added every day and each map can be completed in a few minutes, with the low time commitment making the game a huge hit with casual players. There are many players who would like more puzzles, though.

The developers have been taken aback by the success of the game and are struggling to keep up with demand. They have had to spin up more servers and are looking to hire more engineers to keep working on content. That costs money though, and they are looking to monetise the game. Instead of adding new maps daily they will continually be adding more which players can unlock by completing existing maps. Players will be able to spend their points to unlock hints which will help them progress faster. Hints will also be available to purchase using real-world money, with the possibility of offering multi-buy discounts at a later date.


### **Legal Compliance Analysis:**

**Monetization and Consumer Protection:**
- The Consumer Rights Act 2015 stipulates the customer should not be misled by the costs of the purchases. The game needs to clearly price products so the players know what they bought, there should be no discrepancies between what they get and what they expected to get. 
-The 'Gambling Commission Guidelines' state if in-game purchases involve chances they can be considered gambling-like activities. In this game, if the hints can be classed as 'having different outcomes' then they would need to comply with gambling regulations.


###**Ethical Considerations Analysis:**

**Consumer Protection:** Monetizing the game could risk financially exploiting vulnerable players i.e. children who may end up spending lots of money towards buying hints. This also could lead to addictive spending patterns especially if the game has frequent pop-ups to buy 'hints'.

**Addictive Design:** Pressure to buy 'hints' to progress may be viewed as exploiting the customers as well as reducing the enjoyment of current customers who choose not to buy hints. 



###**Addressing Ethical Issues:**
**Consumer Protection:**
-Implementing limitations on how much customers can spend within the game in a specific time period can prevent overspending and decrease the possibility of financially exploiting customers.
-Providing an option for patent control so the parents are more in control can ensure the child follows responsible gaming practices and can also control their in-game spending.

**Addictive Design:** The game should still remain enjoyable without the need to pay for anything, ensuring there is not a "pay-to-win" environment. finding a balance between monetization and player satisfaction would need to be found.

## Scenario 3 (friends.com)
friends.com is a new match-making service to help people socialise when they move to a new area. Users enter their area and a list of their interests before being shown a list of people with similar interests in the area. There's no guarantee of an exact match in interests and the suggested friend could be on the opposite side of the city. Users can freely view each others' profiles and message each other, but the matching service will speed up the process of making new contacts. The site is free with revenue coming from generic banner ads on the page.

Their development plans involve adding a premium membership which will lock many of the existing features behind a paywall. Free users will only be able to view limited versions of profiles and have a daily cap on the number of matches which can be made. Premium users, on the other hand, will now have more specific location settings and be able to filter their matches. To advertise the premium service the free-tier users will be given occasional "trial periods" of the premium tier followed by adverts showing them what they could unlock by subscribing. Additionally the generic banner ads will be replaced by more targeted advertising for local businesses. Users' location data will be shared in order to ensure relevant businesses are being advertised.


### **Legal Compliance Analysis:**

**Data Privacy and Protection:** The company has to comply with GDPR data protection regulations by ensuring they get explicit consent for sharing customer location data for advertising. There needs to be transparency in getting a premium membership by clearly communicating the features/ benefits of subscribing to this membership to ensure they are not breaking any of the consumer protection regulations by misleading the customers.


### **Ethical Considerations Analysis:**

**Personal Data Ownership:** The company should be transparent about how a customer's data is used. The lack of data privacy for non-members could make customers feel uncomfortable with their data being used for commercial purposes without their consent.

**Weak Security and PII Protection:** Sharing users' location data with advertisers could possibly expose them to security risks such as a data breach.

**Social Divide:** Introducing a paywall can exacerbate social inequality, a divide between users who can not afford the premium membership and users who can; this can create feelings of exclusion within the platform.


### **Addressing Ethical Issues:**



**Weak Security and PII Protection:** Protecting customer's personally identifiable information (PII) is the top priority to safeguard their privacy and security, to do this implementing robust security measures, such as encryption would mitigate these risks.


**Personal Data Ownership:** 
-Be transparent by having clear communications regarding the premium membership, the differences between the free and paid features should be clearly explained.

-Find a solution that doesn't compromise customers' details if they decide to not pay for the membership.

-Ensuring that customers have consented and are informed about how their data will be used for advertising purposes.


**Social Divide:** Evaluate the potential impact of introducing a paywall on access and social inequalities, and consider alternative monetization strategies.
